prims method 

GENERALLY,Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are designed to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in an undirected graph. An MST is a subgraph of an undirected graph that connects all the vertices in the graph with the minimum possible total edge weight. These algorithms work by adding edges to the MST one by one, maintaining the property that the tree remains connected and acyclic.

In a directed graph, the edges have a direction and it is possible for there to be multiple paths between two vertices. A directed graph can contain cycles and it is not guaranteed that there exists a tree that connects all vertices in the graph. Therefore, the concept of an MST does not apply to directed graphs and Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms cannot be used to find an MST in a directed graph.

even though the prims algorithm doesnt satisfy directed graphs for this question it visits all the nodes and satisfies the prims equation 
total cost = 1+2+3+2=8
total cost=8
